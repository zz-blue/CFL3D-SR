## CFL3D-SR

CFL3D-SR highlights scale-resolving (SR) simulation. Featured turbulence 
model is an anisotropic minimum-dissipation IDDES model (AMD-IDDES).
Inviscid flux scheme is a blended central/upwind scheme. Enhanced I/O
functions include flow field averaging, animating and sampling.

CFL3D is a structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code. It can be run
in parallel on multiple grid zones with point-matched, patched, overset, or embedded connectivities. Both
multigrid and mesh sequencing are available in time-accurate or steady-state modes.
